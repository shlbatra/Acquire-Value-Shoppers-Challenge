# Acquire-Value-Shoppers-Challenge

Acquire Value Shoppers Challenge is a Kaggle Competition. The Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge asks participants to predict which shoppers are most likely to repeat purchase. 
To aid with algorithmic development, we have provided complete, basket-level, pre-offer shopping history for a large set of shoppers who were targeted for an acquisition campaign. The incentive offered to that shopper and their post-incentive behavior is also provided.
This challenge provides almost 350 million rows of completely anonymised transactional data from over 300,000 shoppers. It is one of the largest problems run on Kaggle to date.
